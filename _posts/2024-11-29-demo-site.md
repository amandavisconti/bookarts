Not sure what we want to call this yet, but wanted to start playing around with a site for our experimental/digital book arts pres/studio/makerspace thing. In particular, I'd like to post my learning and project roadmap, specimen-book sheet, and a call for folks interested in overlapping work (e.g. multilingual printing).
