title: If Lost
---

Hi! I've placed a QR code linking to this page on various letterpress blocks and other supplies. If the item isn't where it lives (e.g. appears lost, isn't at either the Scholars' Lab or Amanda's home), please email AmandaVisconti@Gmail.com. I appreciate it!

The ID numbers on the stickers work like so:
* awv-000 = personally owned by Amanda Wyatt Visconti  
* awvloan-000 = ditto, but has ongoing loan to the Scholars' Lab for public teaching use there  
* slab-000 = owned by the [Scholars' Lab](https://scholarslab.org)

The numbers following those prefixes correspond to a spreadsheet with information about each piece, which will probably be shared on this site and linked here at some future point.
