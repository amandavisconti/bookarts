title: Book Arts FAQ
---
A FAQ I create as I have questions, and update as they're answered. I'm generally *not* looking for folks to email me answers to these, especially the ones that have lots of resources available everywhere. 

For example my question about the difference among types of presses and pressing doesn't need pointing to another definition so much as my grokking/remembering the difference permanently, which is more about time and finding personally resonant/memorable examples.

# FAQ
## What is the difference among different words for various type and illustration sorts?
Which are subsets vs. distinct things? Which can include both words and image vs not? E.g. cuts, blocks, illustrations, catchwords...

linotype vs monotype

## What's the deal with copper cuts?
Their history, comparison in durability, fineness, safety, cost, etc. to lead. Some [starter info](https://www.briarpress.org/56323); a [3-minute film on the process of electroplating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTqGEPjh6g&feature=youtu.be).

## How do I get the variety of types of printing press and pressing methods straight in my head, for good?
(See 2nd paragraph re:not especially needing others' answers to this one...)

## Multilingual letterpress

## Etymology & overlaps with gender etc.
Shane Lin pointed out the [Latin definition of "matrix"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(printing)) as "womb or a female breeding animal".
