We may have a paper copy of this in the donation boxes, but see online PDF for [C&P official instructions and parts list](https://drukwerkindemarge.org/download/documentatie/cp-pilot-manual.pdf).

## Optional: teardown & rebuild
- Take photos before disassembly so know where stuff goes
- Soak all bolts and joints with PB Blaster (not 100% needed but definitely helped smooth things) 
- "It’s been said before but I’ll repeat it here (‘cause I didn’t know until I researched it) that to get the platen off the screws are turned *inward* just a little each in a cross and/or alternating pattern. I used a deep socket on a speed handle and only turned each a smidge until I felt resistance. After awhile it became intuitive of how to approach them – a little here, a little there. Another note is that the platen isn’t light so have a hand on it (or a friend’s hands) – it’ll move when it comes free."
- "[If] remov[ing] the roller frames (221 and 222 in the parts diagram at https://drukwerkindemarge.org/download/documentatie/cp-pilot-manual.pdf)... use a drift to tap out the pin *from the bottom* – this took some time to get it to move on one. Brace the frame with a 2x4 between the two sides and then to use a drift and give a good smack to the rod that you can see through the side of the roller frame to get things loose. There’s a pin (dutch pin?) hidden inside the roller frame itself that keeps it from turning on the shaft so you can’t twist it off."

## Cleaning
These are things various people did or recommended; not meant to do all of these.
- "Wire brushing off loose paint to prep surfaces before dipping in Evaporust"
- "Soak all bolts and joints with PB Blaster (not 100% needed but definitely helped smooth things)"
