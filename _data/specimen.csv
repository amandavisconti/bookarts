* How to use visual braille type (from Swamp Press type foundry website):
-Each character has an identification mark on the shoulder, which does not print, but allows for easy setting, distribution and proofing.
-Spacing: all printed braille is 0.245"" wide in set, so spaces are included in my fonts. Regular 24 pt spacing can also be used.
-Leading: the official standard for vertical height of the braille cell is 0.4"" or 28.5 points, which for letterpress is very, very inconvenient. So I recommend using 4 pts leading and if one wants to be persnickety add in another half point.
-Capitals: a special character denotes that the following character is capitalized. In this font ""•C•"" on the shoulder means ""Cap"".
-Numerals: numerals are created by adding the numeral character (# on the shoulder) before the letter """" for the numeral 1, ""b"" following means 2, and so on. So ""#a#b"" indicates the numeral ""12"".

* How to use embossing braille type (from Swamp Press type foundry website): 
-Setting: on the shoulder of the type is the character identification in relief, and this will not emboss but aids in setting, proofing and redistribution.
